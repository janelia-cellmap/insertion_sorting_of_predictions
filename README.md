# insertion_sorting_of_predictions
Simple insertion sort of predictions. User provides a .txt file which contains a list of all predictions to be compared separated by newlines. An interactive insertion sort algorithm will then run allowing, prompting the user to compare two predictions. This continues until the sort is complete. Outputs are writtent to a file with the same name, appended with 
"sorted_results". If the user quits in the middle of the analysis, the state is saved and the user can start from where they left off.
